# React Fundamentals Project 🚀

This project is a simple yet practical showcase of **React fundamentals** built with **Vite**.  
The goal of this project was to practice and apply the core concepts of React while also experimenting with interactivity using **Framer Motion**.

## 📌 Features & Concepts Covered

- ⚛️ Functional components  
- 🔄 Props and state management (`useState`)  
- ⚡ Handling side effects with `useEffect`  
- 📂 Component structure & reusability  
- 🎨 Smooth animations & drag-and-drop with **Framer Motion**  
- 🚀 Fast development setup with **Vite + HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**  

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

- To move beyond theory and practice **hands-on React fundamentals**  
- To understand how components communicate with props & state  
- To explore how hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` make apps dynamic  
- To experiment with **Framer Motion** for animations and drag-and-drop functionality  
- To gain confidence in setting up and running a React + Vite environment  

This is not a production-ready app — it’s a **learning-focused project** designed to solidify the basics of React while making the interface more interactive.
